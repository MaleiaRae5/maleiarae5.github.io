    <h1 Style= color:green;">Stress Levels</h1>
    <p style= color:magenta;">Kids stress levels at school are really high. Some kids have really bad coping skills for stress, like harming themselvs or other horrible actions.<br> Parents dont understandd what kids are going through and add to their level of stress. Its really hard on kids that are just trying to live their childhood.<br> I know that some adults can feel this level of stress to but kids that are just trying to live their life shoudnt have to feel that way. Parents say to their kids to not rush on growing<br> up but with the level of stress most kids in middle schoole feel is rudhing their chiledhood and making them grow up faste.<hr> </p>
